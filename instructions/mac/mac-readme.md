# Mac-Project

This is a simple prototype of the Windows Project ported to work on Mac OS. It is using XCode and C++. The Mac project works on M1 and Intel macs.

- Only mouse input and video stream are supported. Nothing else.
- It only works with the v0.8.1 Switch app.
- No gamepad support.
- Only supports limited settings from the Encoder configuration screen on the Switch app.

See the instructions/mac/mac-instructions.md file for setup instructions.

Tested on:
