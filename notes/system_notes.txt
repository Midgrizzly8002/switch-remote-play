switch implementation notes

atomic lock free availability
    all primitive data types are lock free (including float, double, and pointers)
    trivial structs are lock free (SDL_Color for example)
        -- need to test if this is due to SDL_Color being 4 bytes

std::thread
    dangling threads will cause a crash once they try to cleanup
    detach will cause a crash

System resources (pl and rfs)
    resource setup calls need to be mirrored with resource cleanup calls
    plInitialize allows access to getting the system font data
        requires calling plExit when finished with it
            -- failing to do so, will require the HB app to be closed, 
            otherwise the app will crash HB menu if opened consecutively
    rfsInit is the same as well
