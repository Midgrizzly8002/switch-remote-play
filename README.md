# switch-remote-play

Let the switch remotely play PC games (similar to steam link or remote play)

This project is inspired by the github project 'In-Home-Switching' and 'SkyNX'. The goal is to make a convenient streamer/client application to be used to remote play PC games on the switch.

In-Home-Switching and SkyNX already offer the ability to do so, however there were some convenience features missing that I wanted to add. I also recently was studying multi-threading and when I saw the code, I thought 'this is the perfect chance to try writing it in C++'.

## Planned Features

- Automatically connect switch and PC stream applications
- Stream audio from remote connection to the switch
- Stream input from the switch to remote connection
- Configure stream settings from switch and update remote connection settings
- Disconnect / Reconnect stream at will
- Desktop application to manage stream output
